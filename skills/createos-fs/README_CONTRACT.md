# 📄 `README_CONTRACT.md` — Setup, Usage & Operator Guidance

## Purpose

This contract defines **what the backend README must contain** and **what it must not**.

It exists to ensure that:

* a user can run the backend without guidance
* setup steps are explicit and reproducible
* assumptions are documented
* the backend is operable once dependencies are available

The README is an **operator guide**, not a design document.

---

## Core Principle

> **If someone cannot run the backend using the README alone, the README is incomplete.**

---

## Mandatory Sections

Every backend generated by this skill **must include** the following sections, in this order.

---

### 1️⃣ Project Overview

Must include:

* One-paragraph description of what the backend does
* High-level responsibilities (e.g. API server, data storage)
* Explicit statement of what is intentionally stubbed or deferred

Must NOT include:

* Marketing language
* Architectural philosophy
* Implementation details

---

### 2️⃣ Pr
Must list **explicit external dependencies**, such as:

* Node.js version
* PostgreSQL requirement
* Any other required services

Assume nothing is installed unless stated.

---

### 3️⃣ Environment Variables

Must include:

* Complete list of required environment variables
* Short description of each
* Reference to `.env.example`

Example format:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://...
PORT=3000
```

Must NOT include:

* real credentials
* environment-specific secrets

---

### 4️⃣ Database Setup & Migrations

Must explain:

* How to create the database
* How to run migrations
* What command initializes schema

Must be copy-paste runnable.

If no migrations exist, this must be stated explicitly.

---

### 5️⃣ Running the Server

Must include:

* Exact command(s) to start the backend
* Expected startup output (high level)
* Default port behavior

---

### 6️⃣ API Documentation (Swagger)

Must include:

* Where Swagger is hosted (URL)
* How to access it once the server is running
* Statement that SI contract

---

### 7️⃣ Deferred / Placeholder Functionality

Must list:

* Which features are placeholders
* What they return today
* What is expected to replace them later

This section must exist if **any placeholders are present**.

---

### 8️⃣ Common Issues / Notes (Optional but Recommended)

May include:

* Typical setup mistakes
* Environment variable errors
* Database connection issues

This section should be short and practical.

---

## Tone & Style Rules

The README must be:

* concise
* direct
* technical
* free of fluff

Avoid:

* long explanations
* tutorials
* justification of design decisions

---

## Forbidden Content

The README must NOT:

* Explain internal architecture (contracts handle this)
* Include code walkthroughs
* Include deployment guides unless explicitly requested
* Contain TODOs or vague instructions

---

## Success Criteria

This contract is satisfied if:

* A developer can set up and run the backend in one sitting
* No prior context is required
* All required conon is discoverable
* Deferred features are clearly called out

---

## Failure Conditions

This contract is violated if:

* Steps are missing or ambiguous
* Environment variables are undocumented
* Database setup requires guessing
* Swagger location is unclear
* Placeholders are undocumented

---

## Summary

This contract ensures the README is:

* practical
* complete
* operator-focused
* trustworthy

> **The README is the handshake between the backend and its user.**
